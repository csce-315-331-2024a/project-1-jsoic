                <p>I encourage giving back to my community through different volunteer activities... </p>
                <p>In the past, I have participated in Texas A&M’s track and Field camp (2022). During the camp athletes from the ages 12-18 come to the campus to work on their track event. During the camp, I spent the duration of the week working with young athletes in strength and conditioning drills, Javelin exercises, and minor weightlifting. The experience taught me the value of giving back to a community with like-minded individuals. My father instilled in me that “you cannot give what you do not have”. Meaning that it is important to be a part of these communities to complete the cycle of learning and teaching. When one acquires a certain level of skill it is important that they relay it to younger, less experienced people to further their knowledge and others.</p>
                <p>In the future, I hope to mentor younger students who are seeking opportunities in the cybersecurity sector. I aim to contribute more towards educating others about cybersecurity and the importance of online security. I believe that by sharing knowledge and fostering a sense of responsibility in others, we can collectively create a safer digital environment.</p>
